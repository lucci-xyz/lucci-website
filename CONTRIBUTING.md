## Getting Started

### Code Style

- We use Prettier for code formatting (run `npm run format`)
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Write meaningful commit messages

### Testing

- Add tests for new components in `__tests__/`
- Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
- Check that the build succeeds: `npm run build`

## Project Structure

- `/app` - Next.js pages and API routes
- `/components` - Reusable React components
- `/lib` - Utility functions and helpers
- `/data` - Static data (projects.json)
- `/content` - MDX content (research posts)
- `/public` - Static assets

## Adding Content

### Adding a Project

Edit `data/projects.json` and add your project following the existing format:

```json
{
  "name": "ProjectName",
  "blurb": "Brief description",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "status": "alpha",
  "githubUrl": "https://github.com/...",
  "siteUrl": "https://..."
}
```

### Adding a Research Post

Create a new `.mdx` file in `content/research/` with frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: "Post Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
summary: "Brief summary"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---

# Content here
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

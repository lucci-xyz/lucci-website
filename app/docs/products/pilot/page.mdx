# Pilot

An AI agent that automates everything outside the repo—marketing, coordination, token allocation—so developers can focus on code.

**Status:** Coming Soon

## Overview

Pilot is an intelligent automation layer for open source projects. While developers focus on writing code, Pilot handles the operational overhead that typically distracts from core development work.

### Key Features

- **Marketing Automation**: Generate content, manage social media, and engage with your community
- **Project Coordination**: Triage issues, schedule releases, and coordinate contributors
- **Token Allocation**: Automate token distribution based on contributions and milestones
- **Community Management**: Monitor discussions, answer common questions, and nurture your community

## How It Works

Pilot integrates with your repository and learns from your project's history, community interactions, and development patterns. It then proactively handles routine tasks while keeping you informed of important decisions.

### Workflow

1. **Install Pilot** on your repository
2. **Configure** your automation preferences and rules
3. **Review** Pilot's suggested actions and provide feedback
4. **Let Pilot** handle the routine work while you code

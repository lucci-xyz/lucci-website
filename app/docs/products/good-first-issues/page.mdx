Create great first issues:

```markdown
## Issue Title: Add validation to user input

**Description:**
Currently, the user input form doesn't validate email addresses.
We need to add email validation using a standard library.

**Steps:**
1. Find the UserForm component in `src/components/UserForm.tsx`
2. Import a validation library (we recommend `validator.js`)
3. Add email validation before form submission
4. Show error message if email is invalid

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Invalid emails show error message
- [ ] Valid emails pass validation
- [ ] Tests added for validation logic

**Helpful Resources:**
- [validator.js docs](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js)
- Our [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
**Skills Required:** TypeScript, React basics
```

## Architecture

### Issue Crawler

```typescript
// Simplified crawler logic
async function crawlIssues() {
  const projects = await getProjectList()
  const issues = []
  
  for (const project of projects) {
    const repoIssues = await github.getIssues({
      repo: project.github,
      labels: 'good first issue',
      state: 'open'
    })
    
    issues.push(...repoIssues)
  }
  
  await database.saveIssues(issues)
}

// Run every hour
schedule.every(1).hour(crawlIssues)
```

### Frontend

```typescript
// Issue list component
export function IssueList() {
  const [issues, setIssues] = useState([])
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState({})
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchIssues(filters).then(setIssues)
  }, [filters])
  
  return (
    <div>
      <FilterBar onChange={setFilters} />
      {issues.map(issue => (
        <IssueCard key={issue.id} issue={issue} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

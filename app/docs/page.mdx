# Lucci Docs

Short, honest, and practical.

## Philosophy
Move fast. Measure risk. Ship the useful parts. If expectations rug, learn and iterate.

## Projects
- **BountyEscrow** — On‑chain escrow for GitHub issues.
- **FeeVault** — Minimal owner‑controlled vault.
- **RiskLedger** — Weekly risk roots.

## Contributing
We accept PRs. Prefer small, reviewable changes. If you break things, leave a note.

## Support
This is an R&D playground. There is no helpdesk. Open a GitHub issue and bring logs.

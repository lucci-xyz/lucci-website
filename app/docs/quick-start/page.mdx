# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Lucci Labs products quickly. This guide will walk you through the basics of integrating our tools into your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** installed on your system
- **Git** for cloning repositories
- **A Web3 wallet** (MetaMask, Rainbow, etc.) for blockchain interactions
- **Basic knowledge** of TypeScript, React, and Web3 concepts

## Installation

Most Lucci Labs products can be installed via npm or used directly from GitHub:

```bash
# Clone a repository
git clone https://github.com/lucci-xyz/[product-name]

# Install dependencies
cd [product-name]
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Using BountyPay

BountyPay is our most popular product for automating bounty payouts. Here's how to get started:

### 1. Install the GitHub App

Visit the [BountyPay GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/bountypay) and install it on your repository.

### 2. Fund Your Bounty

```typescript
// Example: Create a bounty on an issue
import { BountyPayClient } from 'bountypay-sdk'

const client = new BountyPayClient({
  apiKey: process.env.BOUNTYPAY_API_KEY
})

await client.createBounty({
  repository: 'owner/repo',
  issueNumber: 123,
  amount: 100, // USDC
  chain: 'base'
})
```

### 3. Issue Gets Resolved

When a contributor closes the issue with a PR, BountyPay automatically:
- Verifies the PR was merged
- Releases payment to the contributor's wallet
- Updates the issue with payment confirmation

## Working with Smart Contracts

For products involving smart contracts (BountyPay, FeeVault), you'll need:

### 1. Configure Your Network

```typescript
// config.ts
export const config = {
  networks: {
    base: {
      rpcUrl: process.env.BASE_RPC_URL,
      chainId: 8453,
      contracts: {
        bountyEscrow: '0x...'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Connect Your Wallet

```typescript
import { createWalletClient, custom } from 'viem'
import { base } from 'viem/chains'

const client = createWalletClient({
  chain: base,
  transport: custom(window.ethereum)
})
```

### 3. Interact with Contracts

```typescript
// Read contract state
const balance = await client.readContract({
  address: contractAddress,
  abi: contractABI,
  functionName: 'getBalance',
  args: [userAddress]
})

// Write to contract
const hash = await client.writeContract({
  address: contractAddress,
  abi: contractABI,
  functionName: 'deposit',
  args: [amount],
  value: amount
})
```

## Development Workflow

Here's our recommended workflow for contributing to Lucci Labs projects:

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/[product-name]
cd [product-name]
```

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Make Changes

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Build the project
npm run build
```

### 4. Submit a PR

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then open a PR on GitHub with a clear description of your changes.

## Common Patterns

### Error Handling

```typescript
try {
  const result = await client.doSomething()
  console.log('Success:', result)
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'USER_REJECTED') {
    console.log('User cancelled transaction')
  } else {
    console.error('Transaction failed:', error)
  }
}
```

### Gas Optimization

```typescript
// Estimate gas before sending transaction
const gasEstimate = await client.estimateGas({
  to: contractAddress,
  data: encodedData
})

// Add 20% buffer
const gasLimit = (gasEstimate * 120n) / 100n
```

### Event Listening

```typescript
// Listen for contract events
const unwatch = client.watchContractEvent({
  address: contractAddress,
  abi: contractABI,
  eventName: 'BountyCreated',
  onLogs: (logs) => {
    console.log('New bounty created:', logs)
  }
})
```

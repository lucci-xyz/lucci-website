# Zero-Knowledge Primitives for Smart Contracts

Zero-knowledge proofs are powerful, but integrating them into production smart contracts requires careful design.

## Current State

Most ZK implementations focus on:
- Simple proof verification
- Basic privacy preserving transfers
- Rollup validity proofs

## What's Missing

1. **Composable private state**: How do contracts interact with hidden data?
2. **Efficient selective disclosure**: Prove properties without revealing values
3. **Gas-optimized verification**: Current proof verification is expensive

## Our Approach

We're building modular ZK primitives that:
- Work with existing Solidity tooling
- Minimize on-chain verification costs
- Enable private DeFi interactions

### Example: Private Balance Proofs

```solidity
// Prove you have sufficient balance without revealing amount
function proveBalance(bytes calldata proof, uint256 threshold) 
  external 
  returns (bool)
{
  return zkVerifier.verify(proof, threshold);
}
```

## Challenges

- Circuit complexity grows quickly
- Trusted setup requirements
- Developer experience gaps

Still early, but the primitives are getting better.

# Token Design Failures: A Field Guide

A collection of ways token designs break in production.

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. The Death Spiral

**Setup**: Token value tied to protocol revenue, but low token value reduces confidence, reducing usage, reducing revenue...

**Example**: Every algorithmic stablecoin that failed.

**Fix**: Don't create circular dependencies between token price and protocol utility.

### 2. Governance Capture

**Setup**: Token holders vote on protocol changes, large holder accumulates majority, protocol becomes extractive.

**Example**: Most DeFi governance tokens within 6 months.

**Fix**: Consider conviction voting, time locks, or give up on governance altogether.

### 3. The Airdrop Dump

**Setup**: Large airdrop to "reward community," recipients immediately sell, price crashes, protocol DOA.

**Example**: Too many to list.

**Fix**: Vest tokens, require meaningful participation, or skip the airdrop.

## What Actually Works

1. **Minimal token utility**: Don't force it
2. **Real revenue sharing**: If you promise yield, deliver yield
3. **Time-based mechanisms**: Vesting, cooldowns, epochs
4. **Accept mercenary capital**: Design for it, don't fight it

## Our Philosophy

We test aggressive models in controlled environments. Some will fail spectacularly. That's the point.

Token design is adversarial game theory. Act accordingly.

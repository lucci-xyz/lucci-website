# Risk, Liquidity, and MEV: Notes from the Lab

Drafts live here. Expect footguns.

## The Problem Space

When building DeFi protocols, we often ignore the adversarial nature of public blockchains. MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) isn't a bugâ€”it's a feature of transparent state machines with competitive block production.

## Key Observations

1. **Liquidity is adversarial**: Every pool is a target for sandwich attacks.
2. **State transparency = price transparency**: Front-running isn't just possible, it's optimal.
3. **Gas auctions incentivize extraction**: Priority fees create a race to extract value.

## Design Implications

- Accept MEV as inevitable
- Design for worst-case extraction scenarios
- Consider private mempools and sealed-bid mechanisms
- Build in explicit fee structures that capture value for protocol users

## Work in Progress

We're exploring mechanisms that:
- Reduce information leakage
- Align MEV with protocol goals
- Distribute extracted value fairly

More to come as experiments evolve.
